# Implementing a Jekyll Theme on Github.io

## TL;DR

*Clone* the Jekyll theme, base your repository on the clone

## Overview

Seems like using a Jekyll theme on GitHub.io should be simple--it is officially supported and there are some excellent looking sites out there. But actually getting it to work proved a bit more annoying than the advertised 'Repository Settings, Choose a Theme' as [touted](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-the-jekyll-theme-chooser/).

I am assuming that you are familiar with Git.

## Procedure

1. Fork the theme using GitHub site
2. Rename forked repository to [username].github.io in repository Settings
3. Pull repository
4. Edit index.md
5. Push change(s)
6. Check [username].github.io
